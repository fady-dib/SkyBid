<!-- Tech stack -->
<img src="./readme/title5.svg"/>

###  SkyBid is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the [Angular app development framework](https://angular.io/). Angular is a dynamic framework that crafts interactive user interfaces, ensuring seamless and responsive interactions across various devices.
- The app uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) a flexible NoSQL database for efficient data storage and retrieval, empowering the application to effectively scale and manage data.
- [Node.js](https://node.js.org/): A runtime environment executing JavaScript server-side, enabling the development of scalable, high-performance web applications.
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/): A lightweight, adaptable web application framework that streamlines Node.js server creation and effortlessly manages backend communication.
- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/): A real-time bidirectional event-based communication library, facilitating live data updates between operators and brokers.

- The app uses the font ["Roboto"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
