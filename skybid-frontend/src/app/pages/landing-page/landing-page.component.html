        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>The Team behind SkyBid has decades of experience in aircraft management, operations, charter brokerage, and
            flight support. We realized there was a glaring issue within the charter market in regard to price accuracy
            and price transparency. We wanted to provide a level playing field for operators and brokers alike.</p>
        <p>So, using our expertise of working on a global level, coupled with our knowledge of serving an international
            customer base, we set about creating the world's first live charter bidding platform.</p>
        <p>The result is SkyBid. An innovative and technically advanced platform that helps charter operators and
            charter brokers find each other from different corners of the world and enables them to execute transactions
            based on price accuracy and transparency, all in real-time.</p>
